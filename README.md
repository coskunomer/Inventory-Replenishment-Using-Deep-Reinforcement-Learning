# Inventory-Replenishment-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
Making Inventory Replenishment Decisions Using Reinforcement Learning Methods as part of the AI for Logistics course in TU/e.

**Assignment 1:** A small inventory replenishment problem with 3 stores and stochastic demands that is solvable to optimality using tabular methods. Transportation costs are excluded.

**Assignment 2:** A larger inventory replenishment problem with 19 stores, trucks, distances and stochastic demands that requires logical approximations to action and state spaces and to the transportation cost solver that assigns trucks to the stores by solving a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). More complex approaches needed to solve (deep reinforcement learning in our case).
